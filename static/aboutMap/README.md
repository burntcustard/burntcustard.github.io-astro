#AboutMap
AboutMap is a project built using the [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) [force layout](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Force-Layout) to create an interesting "about me" type webpage.  

###Example
A live super-up-to-date-and-possibly-broken version can be found [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/28565393/AboutMap/index.html). Have fun dragging my face around.  

###This is work-in-progress!
Eventually I may remove all of my data, and give proper instructions to allow people to make their own versions much easier.  

###Things you can help me fix (a.k.a. known bugs):
* Firefox open-in-new-tab function opens the image, not the hyperlink, in a new tab. No idea why only Firefox.
* Alignment of text labels is done so that nodes on the left of the SVG have right aligned text, and nodes on the right have left aligned (you know what I mean), however, it would be great to implement a better system like [this one](http://bl.ocks.org/MoritzStefaner/1377729) by MoritzStefaner.
* Need more icons!
* Icons are drawn over text, when ideally text should be drawn over icons (or user configurable).

###Credits
Icons created by (or based on) Neil Hainsworth's [Free Social Icons set](https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/free-social-icons).  
Wonderful force layout [examples and API](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Force-Layout).  

###Licence
Use for whatever you want!
